## *What happens once analysis is done?*

## Data products

- Rmd report
- Rmd report with interactive elements
- dashboard, interactive plot
- Shiny app 

## Considerations for end users

- can they interpret output?  
- do they know how to code?  
- do they have R/RStudio installed?  

## Goal  

allow end users to interact with data products without involvement of the developer

## Interactivity using R

## html widgets  

## plotly  

## leaflet

## flexdashboard  

## Making data products meaningful  

- color  
- information  
- size  
- text  
- highlighting  

## Create a portfolio!
